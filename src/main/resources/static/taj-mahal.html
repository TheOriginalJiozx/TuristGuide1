        <h2>The Taj Mahal</h2>
        <p>
            The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, India, is an exquisite example of Mughal architecture and one of
            the most iconic monuments in the world. Commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1631,
            the Taj Mahal was built in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who passed away during
            childbirth. The construction of the mausoleum took approximately 22 years and was completed
            in 1653.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Taj Mahal is renowned for its stunning white marble fa√ßade, which is adorned with intricate
            inlay work of semi-precious stones. The structure features a large central dome surrounded by
            four smaller domes, and it is set amidst lush gardens and reflecting pools. The monument is
            surrounded by a large complex, including a mosque and a guest house, all enclosed by a grand
            red sandstone wall.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Taj Mahal is celebrated for its architectural beauty and is considered a masterpiece of
            Mughal architecture, blending elements from Persian, Indian, and Islamic styles. Its symmetry,
            the precision of its marble craftsmanship, and its serene setting have earned it a place as
            one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to its architectural significance, the Taj Mahal is also a symbol of eternal love
            and has become one of the most popular tourist destinations globally. It continues to attract
            millions of visitors each year who come to admire its beauty and learn about its rich history.
