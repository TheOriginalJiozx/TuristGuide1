        <h2>The Colosseum</h2>
        <p>
            The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an iconic symbol of ancient Rome.
            It was commissioned by Emperor Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty in AD 70, and completed in AD 80
            under his successor and heir, Titus. The Colosseum is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built
            and is still the largest amphitheatre in the world today. It could hold up to 80,000 spectators.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Colosseum was primarily used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as
            mock sea battles, animal hunts, executions, and dramas based on Classical mythology.
            These events were part of the Roman public entertainment and were held in the Colosseum
            as a way for emperors and politicians to gain favor with the populace.
        </p>
        <p>
            The structure of the Colosseum is a marvel of ancient engineering, with its complex system of vaults
            and arches that allowed for the efficient movement of large crowds. The amphitheatre was made
            of concrete and stone, with a retractable awning system to protect spectators from the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although it has suffered damage due to natural disasters such as earthquakes, and was later used
            as a quarry and spoliation site in the Middle Ages, the Colosseum remains one of the greatest
            achievements of Roman architecture and engineering. Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site
            and a major tourist attraction, symbolizing the grandeur of ancient Rome.
