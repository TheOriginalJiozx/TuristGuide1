        <h2>The Eiffel Tower</h2>
        <p>
            The Eiffel Tower, known as "La Tour Eiffel" in French, is one of the most recognizable landmarks
            in the world. Designed by engineer Gustave Eiffel and his company, the tower was constructed
            as the entrance arch for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World's Fair) held in Paris to celebrate
            the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. It was completed on March 31, 1889.
        </p>
        <p>
            Standing at 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest man-made structure
            in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York in 1930. Its iron lattice
            structure was initially criticized by some prominent Parisians, but it has since become an
            enduring symbol of France and a global icon of architectural innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tower is composed of iron and weighs approximately 10,000 tons. It is painted every seven
            years to protect it from rust, and the painting process requires about 60 tons of paint. The
            Eiffel Tower has three observation decks that offer panoramic views of Paris. Visitors can also
            dine in its restaurants and experience its unique design up close.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, the Eiffel Tower attracts millions of visitors each year, making it one of the most
            visited monuments in the world. It continues to be a symbol of modern engineering and artistic
            achievement, representing the spirit of innovation and elegance.
